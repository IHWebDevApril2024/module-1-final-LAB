# Module 1 ending exercises

We managed to create a great team!
The company you work for (CompuglobalHiperMegaNet) is developing a new website. The project manager has asked you to create a page where we display all the workers of the company.

This is the information we have about the workers:

```JSON
[
    {
        "name": "Michael Scott",
        "position": "Project Manager",
        "email": "michael.scott@compuglobalhipermeganet.com",
        "photo": "https://www.lavanguardia.com/uploads/2020/06/29/5fa91c5e49c91.jpeg",
    },
    {

Your goal is to create an html file with a script that generates a card for each worker. The card should contain the information and picture of each character. Display the cards so they fit the screen and are responsive.
The image should be displayed on top of the card, followed by the name, position and email of the worker.

## Iteration 1: Create the HTML structure
Create the HTML structure for the page. You should have a container for the cards.

## Iteration 2: Link the css
Add the css to your page and start adding some styles. The container should be perfectly centered in the middle of the screen.

## Iteration 3: Add the array of workers in your script
Just copy the array of workers and paste it in your script. You can create a variable called `workers` and assign the array to it. 

## Iteration 4: Create the forEach loop
Now that we have our array ready, we can start creating the cards.
The first step is to create a forEach loop that iterates over the array of workers.
Let's create that loop and console log each worker to check if everything is working correctly.


## Iteration 5: Create the cards

Create a script that generates a card for each worker.
Here's an example of how a card can look like:

```html
<div class="card">
    <img src="https://example.jpeg" alt="Michael Scott">
    <h2>Michael Scott</h2>
    <h3>Project Manager</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="mailto:michael@example.com">
            mailto:michael@example.com
        </a>
    </p>
    <button>See details</button>
</div>
```
But wait! Don't hardcode the information! Use the information from the array of workers to create the cards.

Do you remember the methods to create new elements in the DOM?
```javascript
const card = document.createElement("div") // creates a new div element
```
I'm not going to tell you how to add classes or ids to the elements! ü§ê

Don't forget to append the cards to the container!

```javascript	
document.querySelector(".container").appendChild(card) // this is just an example, you should use your own code
```

## Iteration 6: Oh no!
Oh no! The manager forgot to tell you, there is a detail missing **for each** worker. We need to add to the array the property `id` of each worker. If they don't have an ID they won't be able to enter the building. üò±

Create and call a function that adds an `id` to each worker. The `id` should be a number starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 **for each** worker. This ID doesn't need to be displayed in the card. Just add a console log to check if the ID is being added correctly.

```javascript
console.log(workers[0]) 
// should display {id: 1, name: "Michael Scott", position: "Project Manager", email: ...
```

## Iteration 7: Details button
This iteration is to make you suffer a little bit more. üòà
That's not something we have practiced yet, try to do your approach first and look for documentation if you get stuck.
You can check a possible solution by taking a look at the solution branch on the github repository. 
Remember that solution is just one of many possible solutions. And also using the knowledge we have so far üí™
Each card should have a button that takes us to a **new page** with only the information of that worker. 

Do you remember how to link to a new page?
```html
<a href="./new-page.html">Go to new page</a>
```

After this amazing and painful iteration, you are ready to start working with React! üöÄ
